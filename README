An example of building the x86_64 version of the Unity WebRTC plugin with a
docker container. The current implementation relies on the webrtc-android.zip
being present in a "result" folder. This is just a temporary mechanism to pass
in the zip file to the script. A more suitable method needs to be explored
further.

Requires approximately 20gig disk space.

sudo ./build.sh # To build the image.

sudo ./run-debug.sh # To launch the image but not run the script.

sudo ./run.sh # To execute the script using the image.
